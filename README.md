# Altruist

MadHacks 2023 Project

Made with SvelteKit, Bootstrap, ExpressJS, and boba tea.

## Idea

Altruist is a platform that allows users to easily volunteer at local organizations. It allows users to search for organizations in their area (well, the filter isn't done yet), and then allows them to sign up for volunteer opportunities. It also allows organizations to post volunteer opportunities, and allows them to view the volunteers that have signed up for their opportunities.

It's also a relatively complex app with many different parts, at least compared to my previous attempts at websites. Databases, APIs, frontend, email, etc.

## Sponsor Challenges

You know what I like? A challenge. You know what I like more? A challenge that I can win. You know what I like even more than that? A challenge that I can win and get free stuff. You know what I like even more than that? A challenge that I can win and get free stuff and then brag about it on the internet.

Anyway the goal was to learn as many different tools as possible in 24 hours and hopefully make something cool. None of us knew how to use SvelteKit and I had to learn Bootstrap CSS.
